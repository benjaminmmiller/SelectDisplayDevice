# SelectDisplayDevice
A basic Java Swing window that allows the user to select an available display device (monitor) so something can be launched on the given display device (in my case, Selenium WebDriver instances). Also contains an “Identify Display” button which launches a popup window on each available display device that contains some basic display information (Display ID and Resolution).
